 <h1>The Best Movies According to Carlos</h1>
 <h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Natural Born Killers</h3>
<p>The first time I watched it, I was 10 years old, 
and since then I can't get enough of it.</p>
<h3>Apocalipsis Now</h3>
<p>Aside from the atrocities of the Vietnam War, I was amazed at the idea of what we 
can become by pursuing an ideal of greatness or madness.</p>
<h3>My Life as a Courgette</h3>
<p>A hopeful movie that taught me that even if the world 
pushes you down, you can move forward.</p>
